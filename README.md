Last week there was a terrible US State Department <a href="https://eju.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Informe-del-departamento-de-estado-de-USA-sobre-elecciones-2019-Bolivia.pdf">report</a> about Bolivia's 2019 political crisis that repeated a lot of bad information about the election, which got me thinking about the dispute again. I did research on it that I think is valuable but received almost no recognition. Most notably, I explained in technical terms what caused an HTTP traffic increase that provoked the disruption of the preliminary vote count. This event sparked a socio-political crisis that, three weeks later, resulted in the forced resignation of Bolivian president Evo Morales. However, I only gave the explanation in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/srslyjuststop/comments/eiu6g1/discussion_about_ethical_hacking_graph_issues_bo1/">Reddit post</a>. Maybe it's better to upload a Jupyter Notebook file instead?

Github doesn't render the Jupyter Notebook file correctly, though, so view it on <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/futurebum/bo1-post/blob/main/bo1-post.ipynb">nbviewer</a> instead.
